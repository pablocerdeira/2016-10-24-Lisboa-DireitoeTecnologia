Although not detailed in the proposed regulation, city authorities would have all the tools to design and enforce a differentiated fee for vehicle-kilometers used in congested areas or during peak hours, and to discount the fee for credits to serve disabled passengers, underserved areas or late-night hours. The regulation will also allow Mobilab to monitor TNC services and how passengers respond to price changes. Ideally, an independent technical evaluation of the impacts of this approach would be performed in relation to private vehicle ownership, complementarity options with public transport, accessibility in underserved areas, road safety and security (including drunk driving), vehicle emissions and other externalities from road vehicle use.
